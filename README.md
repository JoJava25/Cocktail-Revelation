## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

When the user searches the app plugs that value into a cocktail API and returns a JSON object with every possible drink from the search. The app plugs the information from the drink into the DOM and allows the user to cycle through different drinks that are related to the search. 

## Optimizations

When I have time I would very much like to come back to this app and work on a number of things

  - Refactor all of the JavaScript as it is currently a bit difficult to read. 
  - Add links to online retailers for all of the ingredients displayed so that the user can easily have access to everything they need to make a drink directly from the app.
  - Add a Node.js backend that utilizes Mongodb so that users can log in and bookmark drinks.
